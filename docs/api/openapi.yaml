  title: GoHighLevel Clone API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Comprehensive REST API for a GoHighLevel clone platform.

    This API provides complete functionality for managing agencies, locations (sub-accounts),
    contacts, conversations, opportunities, calendars, workflows, campaigns, payments, sites,
    and AI agents.

    ## Authentication
    Most endpoints require authentication using JWT Bearer tokens.

    ## Rate Limiting
    - Standard: 100 requests/minute
    - Professional: 500 requests/minute
    - Enterprise: 2000 requests/minute

    ## Pagination
    List endpoints support cursor-based pagination with `limit` and `cursor` parameters.

    ## API Versioning
    The API uses URL-based versioning (/v1). Breaking changes will be introduced in new versions.
